This is a website for the yet unpublished game the Judge

The judge is a social detuction (SD) game from  6 to 13 players. The differentiator between other SD games such as (werewolves, avalon, town of salem,...) is that there is a person, namely, the judge that is confirmed on the honest team who has to figure out which of the other players
are on the honest team and which are on the corrupt team in order to win. the in-depth rules can be found on the rules tab
