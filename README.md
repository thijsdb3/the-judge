## 🎮 About the Game  

**The Judge** is a social deduction (SD) game for **6 to 13 players**.  
Unlike other SD games such as *Werewolves*, *Avalon*, or *Town of Salem*,  
this game introduces a unique twist:  

👉 A confirmed **Judge**, who is guaranteed to be on the honest team.  

The Judge must determine which of the other players are **honest** and which are **corrupt** in order for the honest team to win.  

📜 The in-depth rules can be found under the **Rules tab** of the website.
